    <p><b>Biography:</b> I am born orginially in Chicago, my parents are both Chinese. I take pleasure from doing coding during my spare time, but major avocations that I develop on are visual arts and swimming. I also love climbing bars, and I used to want to do gymnastics. Coding is very fun for me, and even though I am a beginer, I wish to furthr study this subject.</p>

    <p><b>Preferences:</b> Only recently I got into bird watching and I bought a book on it. I find it fasinating to watch the birds and sometimes feed them. I have seen quite a number of different birds and I wish that as I travel to other places, I will be able to see more variety of the species. <br>
      <b>Dislikes:</b> I am very sensitive to any insects, they creep me out so much.<br>
    </p>
    
      <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> When it comes to video games, I love playing minecraft in creative mode and using the old world. <br></p>

      <b>Side Scroller Project</b><br>
      Last week, I build a cool side scroller project in Scratch. To build it, I learned about storyboarding, graphic design and using the concepts of functions, loops, conditionals, and variables. Check out the screenshot below!<br><br>
